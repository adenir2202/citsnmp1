= SNMP Library for EventMachine

== Summary

This gem extends Ruby-SNMP[http://snmplib.rubyforge.org] to use the asynchronous EventMachine[http://rubyeventmachine.com] library for added performance and scalability. This allows code to scale monitoring applications to access a very high number of devices without the need for complex asynchronous I/O handling.


== Features

Version 1.0.0 supports:

* SNMP v1 and v2 
* SNMP Get, GetNext, Set, and Walk requests. For SNMPv2 clients, GetBulk and WalkBulk
* Ability to query/set/walk multiple OIDs in parallel.

Future revisions of this library may support:

* Ability to act as an SNMP agent, responding to external queries.

There are no plans to support SNMP v3.


== Backwards compatibility

Version 1.0.0 tweaks the return values of a few functions. Please test code thoroughly before upgrading to 1.0.0 in production!


== Running tests

This library now includes a full suite of functional tests. They communicate with an SNMP daemon running on the localhost. The library comes with the necessary configuration, but it's much easier to fire up the provided rake task (`rake server`), running in a separate terminal window, before running `rspec`. This works fine on a Mac OS X machine using homebrew (`brew install net-snmp`).

== Examples

A few definitions:

  OID_SYSTEM = "1.3.6.1.2.1.1"
  OID_SYSNAME = "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0"
  OID_SYSLOCATION = "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.6.0"

A simple SNMP-GET:

  EM.run {
    snmp = SNMP4EM::Manager.new(:host => "192.168.1.1")
  
    request = snmp.get([OID_SYSNAME, OID_SYSLOCATION])
  
    request.callback do |response|
      puts "System name = #{response[OID_SYSNAME]}"
      puts "System location = #{response[OID_SYSLOCATION]}"
    end
  
    request.errback do |error|
      puts "GET got error #{error}"
    end
  }

A simple SNMP-GETNEXT:

  EM.run {
    snmp = SNMP4EM::Manager.new(:host => "192.168.1.1")

    request = snmp.getnext(OID_SYSNAME)

    request.callback do |response|
      r = response[OID_SYSNAME]
      puts "The next OID is #{r[0]}, the next value is #{r[1]}"
    end

    request.errback do |error|
      puts "GETNEXT got error #{error}"
    end
  }

A simple SNMP-SET:

  EM.run {
    snmp = SNMP4EM::Manager.new(:host => "192.168.1.1")

    request = snmp.set({OID_SYSNAME => "My System Name", OID_SYSLOCATION => "My System Location"})

    request.callback do |response|
      if (response[OID_SYSNAME] == true)
        puts "System name set successful"
      else
        puts "System name set unsuccessful: #{response[OID_SYSNAME]}"
      end

      if (response[OID_SYSLOCATION] == true)
        puts "System location set successful"
      else
        puts "System location set unsuccessful: #{response[OID_SYSLOCATION]}"
      end
    end

    request.errback do |error|
      puts "SET got error #{error}"
    end
  }

A simple SNMP-WALK:

  EM.run {
    snmp = SNMP4EM::Manager.new(:host => "192.168.1.1")

    request = snmp.walk(OID_SYSTEM)

    request.callback do |response|
      response[OID_SYSTEM].each do |oid, value|
        puts "#{oid} = #{value}"
      end
    end

    request.errback do |error|
      puts "WALK got error #{error}"
    end
  }

A simple SNMP-BULKWALK:

  EM.run {
    snmp = SNMP4EM::Manager.new(:host => "192.168.1.1")

    request = snmp.bulkwalk(OID_SYSTEM)

    request.callback do |response|
      response[OID_SYSTEM].each do |oid, value|
        puts "#{oid} = #{value}"
      end
    end

    request.errback do |error|
      puts "BULK-WALK got error #{error}"
    end
  }

A simple SNMP-GET-BULK:

  EM.run {
    snmp = SNMP4EM::Manager.new(:host => "192.168.1.1")

    request = snmp.getbulk(OID_SYSTEM)

    request.callback do |response|
      response[OID_SYSTEM].each do |oid, value|
        puts "#{oid} = #{value}"
      end
    end

    request.errback do |error|
      puts "GET-BULK got error #{error}"
    end
  }
